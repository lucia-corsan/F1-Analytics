# Formula One Analytics
Jupyter notebooks with the automatized process to obtain the necessary data from F1 API, resulting in Looker interactive dashboards.
- Final grade: 9.2/10.

# Tools
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Google Looker Studio
- Python

## The repository contains
- Notebook with the data extraction, cleaning and visualizations.
- PDF with the final dashboards (which can be found in the following [link](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/003df30b-544c-43a5-99d8-fa5aab70ffff))

## Objective
The primary goal is to work with Formula One API Ergast (see Documentation [here](https://ergast.com/mrd/)), as well as to perform Data Analytics and a comparison of Machine Learning techniques from the dataset extracted.

## Expected Results
The final result should represent accurately the statistics and outputs of the ML models for the Formula One drivers, cars and teams in a Looker Dashboard.

## Evaluation Criteria
The project will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
1. Code Execution: Your code must run without errors.
2. Scalability: Your implementation should be scalable, tested with datasets ten times larger on a cluster with 80 execution workers.
3. Optimization: Code optimization is crucial.
4. Documentation: Adequate code documentation is required.
5. Complexity of the Machine Learning techniques: Advanced techniques must be performed.
